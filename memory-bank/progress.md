## Phase 1: Setup and Core Mechanics

### Milestone 1: Unity Project Setup (Day 1)

#### Completed Components:

1. **Core Scripts Structure**
   - Established main script directories (Core, Enemies, Vehicle)
   - Set up basic component hierarchy

2. **Enemy System Implementation**

   - Created ZombieSpawner with wave-based spawning system
   - Added difficulty scaling and spawn point management

3. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Documented core components and their interactions
   - Established design patterns (Singleton, Component, Observer)
   - Outlined future considerations for scalability and performance

#### Next Steps:
1. Implement TruckController for player movement
2. Set up collision detection between truck and zombies
